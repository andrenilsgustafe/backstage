## Introduction - v2 - en Ã¤ndring

The purpose of the documentation strategy is to support the organization with a process to improve the overall effectiveness of our documentation. The process should guide the writers to create light, modular, updated, structured, audience tailored and trustworthy information. 

The strategy also takes into account the challenges of collaboration, review and update processes, however this part of the strategy is pending the decision about what tool we finally use for documentation.
