## Introduction - v2

The purpose of the documentation strategy is to support the organization with a process to improve the overall effectiveness of our documentation. The process should guide the writers to create light, modular, updated, structured, audience tailored and trustworthy information. 

The strategy also takes into account the challenges of collaboration, review and update processes, however this part of the strategy is pending the decision about what tool we finally use for documentation.


The guiding principles of our documentation strategy is:
  *  All documentation in one central space
  *  Distributed contribution - Anyone can contribute
  *  One look and feel
  *  Automatic dependencies between content
  *  Revision controlled - responsible team to review
  *  Searchable content
  *  Structured content (Categories and labels)
  *  All documentation with a purpose


## Step wise approach to great documentation

A series of steps are introduced to provide guidance in the document creation process to cover all the needs for a given piece of documentation.
